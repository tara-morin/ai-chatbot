This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This is an AI chatbot which gives students coding help. The backend is created using Next.js to build the basic of the app. I then imported compnents from Material UI in order to design the front end and make the screen resemble a chatbot. For the AI component, I used Google Gemma 2 9B via Openrouter's API.
